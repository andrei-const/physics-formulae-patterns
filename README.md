The function sets used for the analysis can be found in the `data/` directory.

To perform the implicit inference tests, one can use the script `ili_zipf.py`, which utilises the `ltu-ili`
package ([Ho et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05137)). This can be downloaded and installed as follows

```bash
conda create -n ili-torch python=3.10 
conda activate ili-torch
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e git+https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili#egg=ltu-ili
```
